**What I learned**
Kaggle tutorials are better way to learn many concepts. I started SQL thinking it as usual SQL tutorial but it was fully embedded Python code with Google cloud.

**If I did anything outstanding**
I completed amy validation,documented the findings.

**What I could have done better**
Play more with Coding skills.

**What I would have done differently if I could start the day over**
I will choose learning as early as possible not at the the end of the day when my mind is tired.
